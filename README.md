# EventBModelHybridSystems
This repository contains the following Event-B models:

  1. the generic models that represent the event-triggered and time-triggered patterns proposed by Kopetz
  
  2. the instantiation of the generic models on two case studies: Stop Signal and Water tank systems.

For each case study, we give the models in pdf and the Rodin sources. File Notations gives the Rodin symbol for each mathematical operator.
